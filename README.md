## Experience Building This Portfolio
> Building this portfolio was a rewarding experience as it allowed me to combine my passion for clean, modern web design with my technical skills in HTML and Tailwind CSS. I focused on creating a user-friendly, visually appealing, and fully responsive site that reflects my journey as an aspiring full stack developer. The process helped me deepen my understanding of UI/UX best practices and responsive design, and I enjoyed the challenge of implementing features like the dynamic typing effect and interactive project cards using only utility-first CSS. I look forward to expanding this portfolio as I grow in my career and continue to learn new technologies.
